## Wk11 Project Reflections

app = https://wk11-upvote.vercel.app/

Requirements met = deployed to vercel

Reflection:
I was unable to get the SQL tables to run initally as I had wk9 tables labelled the same. Once I understood this I changed the names of the wk9 tables.

Error fix = An additional comma on the SQL code at the end needed removing to make the query run.

I think this went well. Progress was steady as I followed the instructions and read the details carefully to understand whatelse I needed to do around the instructions.
I returned to my notes and/or the moodle lesson regarding a couple of areas in advance of the steps to make sure my recall was correct.
I also looked at how the files were set up in GitHub to understand what the app was doing - and in which files.

Stretch:
Fixed text colour on /add-post page to white so it shows

Thank you
