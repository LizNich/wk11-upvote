## Wk11 Project Reflections

app = https://wk11-upvote.vercel.app/

Requirements met = deployed to vercel

Reflection:
I was unable to get the SQL tables to run initally as I had wk9 tables labelled the same. Once I understood this I changed the names of the wk9 tables.
I initially thought I had deployed it, but it wouldn't work. I remembered the person in the video said he was using the local host "for now" and when I asked the breakout room we were all seeing the same error. We worked out we needed to change the links to the app webpage.  
Sam also helped me with an additional error where I had missed 2 numbers from the end of one of my env variables.

Error fix = An additional comma on the SQL code at the end needed removing to make the query run.

I think this went well. Progress was steady as I followed the instructions and read the details carefully to understand whatelse I needed to do around the instructions.
I returned to my notes and/or the moodle lesson regarding a couple of areas in advance of the steps to make sure my recall was correct.
I also looked at how the files were set up in GitHub to understand what the app was doing - and in which files.

Stretch:
Fixed text colour on /add-post page to white so it shows.
I adjusted the page number reference in the /page adding "Page" to show what the number was refering to. I also made it slightly smaller in size.

Thank you
Liz
